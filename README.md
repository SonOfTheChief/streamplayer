                        <h3><img height="20px" src="media/news.png"/> HOW TO USE IT</h3>
                        <p>In fact, using this page is pretty simple. If you can't figure it out on your own, I have bad news for you.<sup>just kidding, you're a wonderful person</sup></p>
                        <p>So here's a brief explanation:</p>
                        <ol>
                                <li>In the first box you can define which stream you want to use. You have two possibilities: Set your own or choose one of ours.</li>
                                <span>Remember: The only possible sources are HLS and DASH.</span>
                                <li>According to the type of stream you choose in step 1, only the players which can actually play the type of stream are going to be activated. Choose a player and enjoy.</li>
                                <li>I don't have a third advice, but two seemed like not enough.</li>
                        </ol>
