			<p>In fact, using this page is pretty simple. If you can't figure it out on your own, I have bad news for you.<sup>just kidding, you're a wonderful person</sup></p>
			<p>So here's a brief explanation:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the first box you can define which stream you want to use. You have two possibilities: Set your own or choose one of ours.</li>
				<span>Remember: The only possible sources are HLS and DASH.</span>
				<li>According to the type of stream you choose in step 1, only the players which can actually play the type of stream are going to be activated. Choose a player and enjoy.</li>
				<li>I don't have a third advice, but two seemed like not enough.</li>
</ol>
